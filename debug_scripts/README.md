# Debug Scripts - Quarter Progression Fix

This folder contains debug and test scripts that were created during the troubleshooting and resolution of the quarter progression issue in the Hospital Equipment Maintenance Management System.

## Issue Summary

**Problem**: Dashboard was showing Q2 (second quarter) maintenance dates instead of Q3 (third quarter) data, even though we were in Q3 (July 2025).

**Root Cause**: The Quarter Service progression logic was treating any past maintenance date with an assigned engineer as "complete" and immediately progressing to the next quarter, without considering the current calendar quarter context.

**Solution**: Enhanced the quarter selection logic to prioritize the current calendar quarter and include a 30-day recent maintenance window.

- Tests various scenarios with different equipment data
- Helped identify the root cause of the issue

### `debug_real_data.py`
- Tests the Quarter Service with actual data from the PPM database
- Analyzes real equipment records to understand the data patterns
- Confirmed the fix works with production data

### `test_quarter_fix.py`
- Comprehensive test script for the quarter progression fix
- Tests edge cases and boundary conditions
- Validates the enhanced quarter selection algorithm

### `test_quarter_progression.py`
- Original test script for quarter progression functionality
- Tests the basic quarter progression logic
- Used during initial development and debugging

### `simple_edge_case_test.py`
- Comprehensive edge case testing for the quarter progression fix
- Tests quarter boundaries (Q3/Q4 transition, year-end rollover)
- Validates overdue scenarios, recent maintenance windows, and current quarter prioritization
- All tests passed - confirms fix handles edge cases correctly

## Fix Implementation

The fix was implemented in `app/services/quarter_service.py` in the `get_active_quarter_for_equipment()` method:

1. **Current Quarter Prioritization**: Check the current calendar quarter first
2. **Overdue Handling**: Show overdue quarters (past date, no engineer) immediately
3. **Recent Maintenance Window**: Continue showing completed maintenance within 30 days
4. **Smart Progression**: Only advance to next quarter if current quarter is truly complete AND past the reasonable timeframe

## Verification

The fix was verified using:
- Unit tests with various data scenarios
- Production testing with live dashboard
- Real data analysis from the PPM database

**Result**: âœ… Dashboard now correctly displays Q3 maintenance data when in Q3 (July 2025)

## Archive Date

These scripts were archived on July 4, 2025, after successful resolution of the quarter progression issue.

**Note**: These scripts are kept for historical reference and future debugging. They can be safely removed if disk space is needed, as the fix has been implemented and verified in production.
